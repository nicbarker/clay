Odin doesn't directly package SDL, so on Windows, you'll want to copy `SDL3.dll` and `SDL3_ttf.dll` into this directory from odin's `vendor/sdl3` directory located next to the compiler. You can use `odin root` to figure out where your compiler is installed. On Linux and Mac, you should install SDL3 via your package manager

## Running on Windows
In an embdedded termninal, missing dependencies will fail silently on Windows, so if you have any unexplainable crashes, make sure the DLLs are in your current working directory (the path you run the command from). It's easiest to just copy them next to this file, and run from here as well.
